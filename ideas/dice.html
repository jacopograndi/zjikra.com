	grid based<br>
turn based (xcom turns)<br>
<br>
each face has attack, defence, range, movement squares<br>
<br>
dice are placed on a chessboard<br>
dice have 1 move and 1 attack<br>
when moved, dice change face as though they are rolling<br>
when movement is done, the dice attacks if able<br>
if attack is higher than enemy defence, enemy dies<br>
<br>
abilities: <br>
skirmish: if not lethal, roll the enemy die<br>
protect: nearby dies have +1 defence<br>
armored: when lethal, roll. if die lands on less defence, dies.<br>
fast: can move again instead of attack<br>
double attack: can attack twice<br>
pin: enemy pieces has 1 less movement<br>
charge: if attack is not lethal, can move by 1<br>
planning: can roll itself instead of move<br>
counterattack: if lethal, attack the attacker if range<br>
reposition: roll itself at the end of the turn<br>
push: if not lethal, move by 1 back the attacker if able<br>
breaktrough: if lethal, attack again<br>
<br>
