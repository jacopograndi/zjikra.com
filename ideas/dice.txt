grid based
turn based (xcom turns)

each face has attack, defence, range, movement squares

dice are placed on a chessboard
dice have 1 move and 1 attack
when moved, dice change face as though they are rolling
when movement is done, the dice attacks if able
if attack is higher than enemy defence, enemy dies

abilities: 
skirmish: if not lethal, roll the enemy die
protect: nearby dies have +1 defence
armored: when lethal, roll. if die lands on less defence, dies.
fast: can move again instead of attack
double attack: can attack twice
pin: enemy pieces has 1 less movement
charge: if attack is not lethal, can move by 1
planning: can roll itself instead of move
counterattack: if lethal, attack the attacker if range
reposition: roll itself at the end of the turn
push: if not lethal, move by 1 back the attacker if able
breaktrough: if lethal, attack again

note: equal lenght paths are different
