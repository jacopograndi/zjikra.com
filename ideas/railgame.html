	gameplay<br>
you are in a station<br>
you can see a couple of stations ahead<br>
you can take one of the mass transports that connect the stations<br>
but you have to wait for it to arrive<br>
you search for cheap drug sellers<br>
when you have drugs, sell them to high paying consumers<br>
you have to eat, eating is not cheap<br>
when you are in a big city, eating is prohibitly costly<br>
manage your backpack space<br>
<br>
worldbuilding<br>
there is chaos in the travel business.<br>
many railway companies are striving to stay alive.<br>
they fight each other to control the smallest slice of the network.<br>
alternative travel means, like taxis, ferries, bus, are troubled in the same way.<br>
train pirates disrupt services and reroute cargo.<br>
guerrilla forces undermine the infrastructure.<br>
fuel is very cheap, running at scale transport never had been so fruitful.<br>
trains are either late, very late or cancelled.<br>
<br>
a smuggler tale<br>
you buy from the production and sell to the consumer.<br>
the trouble is getting back and forth alive.<br>
you have to eat, but in some places it's way too expensive.<br>
<br>
initial thoughs<br>
i think a vertical slice of the game is not very complex.<br>
complexity comes later in the scale of the map, which could be procedural.<br>
it would need a graph.<br>
trains and other transit means<br>
economy simulation (variable drugs and food prices)<br>
survival mechanics<br>
2d interface<br>
