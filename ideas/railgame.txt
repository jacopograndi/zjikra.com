gameplay
you are in a station
you can see a couple of stations ahead
you can take one of the mass transports that connect the stations
but you have to wait for it to arrive
you search for cheap drug sellers
when you have drugs, sell them to high paying consumers
you have to eat, eating is not cheap
when you are in a big city, eating is prohibitly costly
manage your backpack space

worldbuilding
there is chaos in the travel business.
many railway companies are striving to stay alive.
they fight each other to control the smallest slice of the network.
alternative travel means, like taxis, ferries, bus, are troubled in the same way.
train pirates disrupt services and reroute cargo.
guerrilla forces undermine the infrastructure.
fuel is very cheap, running at scale transport never had been so fruitful.
trains are either late, very late or cancelled.

a smuggler tale
you buy from the production and sell to the consumer.
the trouble is getting back and forth alive.
you have to eat, but in some places it's way too expensive.

initial thoughs
i think a vertical slice of the game is not very complex.
complexity comes later in the scale of the map, which could be procedural.
it would need a graph.
trains and other transit means
economy simulation (variable drugs and food prices)
survival mechanics
2d interface
